# Welcome !!!

### What the project is?
We intend to develop a **Object-Oriented-Parallel numerical
library** with aims to solve PDE's by the Finite Element Method and
Mesh Free Methods.

### How to configure it?
Run the script _autogen.sh_ in the main folder and follow the instructions
on screen to configure the library.

#### What you need to have it working and running nicely?
* A C++ compiler - with MPI support to use parallel features.

* CMake - to configure and install.

* Latex and Biber - to build documentation (see notes in the doc
  folder for installation instructions of Latex and Biber).

* Doxygen - to build classes diagrams and useful documentation from
  the code.

### Examples and test cases

Demos, examples or test cases can be found in the "demos" directory
under the root folder. These demos are also used to self test the
implementation. You should run all of them to make sure nothing is
broken.

A large number of examples is expected to live in the "demos"
directory so you can check there for any feature available in the
library.

### License

Mmm ... that is something we need to carefully think about.

### How to contribute

Once we have something intereseting to share with you we will  make the
