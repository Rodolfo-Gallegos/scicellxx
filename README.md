# Welcome !!!

### What the project is?

We intend to develop a **Parallel-Pattern-Object-Oriented numerical
library** with aims to solve PDE's by the Finite Element Method and
Mesh Free Methods.

### How to configure it?

Creating the CMake files :construction:, it will be added soon (cause
it is a really pain to compile every file with the common g++ -Wall
... you know)

#### What you need to have it working and running nicely?

* A C++ compiler - with MPI support to use parallel features.

* CMake - to configure and install.

* Latex and Biber - to build documentation (see notes in the doc
  folder for installation instructions of Latex and Biber).

* Doxygen - to build classes diagrams and useful documentation from
  the code.

### Examples and test cases

Demos, examples or test cases can be found in the "demos" directory
under the root folder. These demos are also used to self test the
implementation. You should run all of them to make sure nothing is
broken.

A large number of examples is expected to live in the "demos"
directory so you can check there for any feature available in the
library.

### License

Mmm ... that is something we need to carefully think about.

### How to contribute

During the initial stage contributions are only allowed by a selected
number of people, but once we have something intereseting to share
with you we will make it open to the public. Please check continuously
for updates or contact the developers by email (I guess the email is
somewhere listed in the gitHub page ... or not).

#### Notes for contributors Please check the documentation for
anything you need to set-up your account, get a copy of the latest
development and start submitting your amazing contributions ....
