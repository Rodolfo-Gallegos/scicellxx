#+STARTUP: showall
#+TITLE: TODO list for CHAPCHOM
#+AUTHOR: Julio César Pérez Sansalvador
* Work on Mesh Free Methods
- Working on Distance Matrix taken from book Mesh Free Approximation
  Methods with MATLAB
- Working on problem of chapter 1
 - 1D
  - Left to review the position of nodes given by an /h/ value, such
   that the distance between nodes is /h/.
  - Then continue with a random generation of nodes' positions
 - 2D
  - Create methods to generate nodes positions
  - Distance between nodes given by an /h/ parameter
  - Random nodes position
- Then move to Chapter 2 of the book and implement the same stuff as
  above
* Work on Documentation
- How to git with CHAPCHOM
