Creating your own project
=========================

The easiest way to start a new project is to use a simple demo as a
template. This workflow creates a new project into your private folder
and copies the required files to start your project.

1. Open a terminal and on the main SciCell++ folder execute the
   following script:

   .. code-block:: shell

      ./tools/user/make_new_project.sh

   You will be prompted for your user name and your new project
   name. Make sure not using white spaces or special characters.


2. Open the new ``CMakeLists.txt`` file in your newly created project
   folder and ensure to include any additional modules that you may
   need.

   In this template we only include the ``general_lib`` and the
   ``problem_lib`` modules. Check the :doc:`modules` document for the
   full list of module and their details.

3. In the main folder of SciCell++ type:

   .. code-block:: shell

      ./autogen.sh

   to register your project (you may skip running demos). Once
   building finish without errors then you can build your own project.

Building and executing your project
-----------------------------------

In a terminal follow these instructions:

1. Go to the ``build`` folder in the main SciCell++ folder and type:

   .. code-block:: shell
   
      make demo_sophy
      
   Make sure to substitute ``demo_sophy`` by your project name. It
   should be a combination of your ``user name`` + ``your project
   name``. Use ``TAB`` to autocomplete.
   
   The building output should be displayed at your screen. Once no
   errors have been reported you may run your code.

2. Go to your ``project folder`` into your ``private`` folder and
   type:

   .. code-block:: shell

      ./bin/demo_sophy

   Make sure to substitute ``demo_sophy`` by the name of your
   project. Use ``TAB`` for autocomplete.
                   
3. You should see the output of your project at the terminal.

.. important:: As you noticed, the generation and execution of your
               project is performed in two different folders:

               * the ``build`` folder (building)
               * your ``private/project_name`` folder (execution)

               We use this two-folders strategy to avoid cluttering
               the folder structure of SciCell++ with files
               automatically generated by CMake. By following this
               strategy we keep a clean folder structure for SciCell++
               and group all files generated by CMake in the ``build``
               folder. This help us to keep track for changes easily
               since we can exclude the whole ``build`` folder from
               the git repository.

               **Just keep in mind the following:**

               * Whenever you want to build your project you need to
                 do so in the ``build`` folder, inthere just type
                 ``make`` followed by the name of your project.

               * Whenever you want to execute your project go to your
                 ``private/project_name`` folder and type
                 ``./bin/the-name-of-your-project``.
                 
   
2. Type the following to copy the demo driver into your private folder:

   .. code-block:: shell

      cp ../../demos/interpolation/basic_interpolation/demo_basic_interpolation.cpp demo_john.cpp

3. Copy the ``CMakeLists.txt.private_template`` file from the
``tools`` folder into your private directory and change its name to
``CMakeLists.txt``

   .. code-block:: shell

      cp ../../tools/CMakeLists.txt.private_template CMakeLists.txt

4. Change the content of the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file as follow:

  * Change all the instances of the tag ``SRC_demo_john`` for your own
    tag to identify your source code. For example: ``SRC_project_sophy``.

  * Change all the instances of ``demo_john.cpp`` for the name of your
    source code file. For example: ``project_sophy.cpp``.

  * Change all the instances of ``demo_john``, this will be the name
    of your executable and the name you need to type at the terminal
    to compile your project. For example:``project_sophy``.
    
  * Change all the instances of the tag ``LIB_demo_john`` for your own
    tag to identify libraries required for your code. For example:
    ``LIB_project_sophy``.

  * Include the modules you need. In the template we only include the
    ``general_lib`` and the ``problem_lib`` modules. Check the
    :doc:`modules` document for the full list of module and their
    details.

5. Go to the root folder of SciCell++ and execute the ``./autogen.sh``
   script. If you find errors please make sure you correctly changed
   all the tags indicated in the previous step. Once building has
   finished without errors you can build your own project.

**Building and executing your project**

Open a terminal and follow these instructions:

1. Go to the ``build`` folder in the root SciCell++ folder and type

   .. code-block:: shell
   
      make demo_sophy
      
   The building output should be displayed at your screen. Once no
   errors have been reported you may run your code.

2. Go to your ``private`` folder, create a ``RESLT`` folder if you
   have no one, and type:

   .. code-block:: shell

      ./bin/demo_sophy
                   
3. You should see the output of your project at the terminal.
