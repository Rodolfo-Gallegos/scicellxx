Creating your own project
=========================

The easiest way to start a new project is to use a simple demo as a
template. This workflow creates a new project into your private folder
and copies the required files to start your project.

1. Open a terminal and on the main SciCell++ folder execute the
   following script:

   .. code-block:: shell

      ./tools/user/make_new_project.sh

   You will be prompted for your user name and your new project
   name. Make sure not using white spaces or special characters.

   .. important:: Take note of the script summary creation since you
                  will need those information to build and execute
                  your project.

2. Open the new ``CMakeLists.txt`` file in your newly created project
   folder and ensure to include any additional modules that you may
   need.

   In this template we only include the ``general_lib`` and the
   ``problem_lib`` modules. Check the :doc:`modules` document for the
   full list of module and their details.

Building and executing your project
-----------------------------------

Open a terminal and follow these instructions.

Building your project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. Go to the ``build`` folder in the main SciCell++ folder and type:

   .. code-block:: shell
   
      make julio_test
      
   Make sure to substitute ``julio_test`` by the reported
   ``building/executable project name`` by the new project creation
   script. It should be a combination of your ``user name`` + ``your
   project name``.
   
   The building output should be displayed at your screen. Once no
   errors have been reported proceed to the following step to execute
   your project.

Executing your project
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
   
1. Go to your ``project folder`` into your ``private`` folder and
   type:

   .. code-block:: shell

      ./bin/julio_test

   Make sure to substitute ``julio_test`` by the reported
   ``building/executable project name`` by the new project creation
   script. It should be a combination of your ``user name`` + ``your
   project name``. Use ``TAB`` for autocomplete.
                   
2. Your project's output should be displayed on your screen.

.. important:: As you noticed, the generation and execution of your
               project is performed in two different folders:

               * the ``build`` folder (building)
               * your ``private/project_name`` folder (execution)

               We use this two-folders strategy to avoid cluttering
               the folder structure of SciCell++ with files
               automatically generated by CMake. By following this
               strategy we keep a clean folder structure for SciCell++
               and group all files generated by CMake in the ``build``
               folder. This help us to keep track for changes easily
               since we can exclude the whole ``build`` folder from
               the git repository.

               **Just keep in mind the following:**

               * Whenever you want to build your project you need to
                 do so in the ``build`` folder, inthere just type
                 ``make`` followed by the name of your project.

               * Whenever you want to execute your project go to your
                 ``private/project_name`` folder and type
                 ``./bin/the-name-of-your-project``.
