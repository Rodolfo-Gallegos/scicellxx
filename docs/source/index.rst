SciCell++
=========

SciCell++ is an object-oriented framework for the simulation of
biological and physical phenomena modelled as continuous or discrete
processes.

A framework, not a library
--------------------------

SciCell++ is a **software framework**, that means, we provide you with
the main code structure and you only have to fill-in the specific
details for your project. In a library, you are in charge of the main
flow of the program and the tools that you include.

The code that you write becomes part of the framework, this will help
others to build on your code just as you built on the code wrote by
them. We encourage you to personalise SciCell++ based on your needs
**by extending** its current behavior to provide it with extra
functionalities.
