External packages intallation
=============================

If you want to get the maximum performance for SciCell++ you will need
to install the following external packages.

* `OpenBLAS <https://www.openblas.net/>`_
* `SuperLU <https://portal.nersc.gov/project/sparse/superlu/>`_ (requires OpenBLAS)
* `Armadillo <http://arma.sourceforge.net/>`_ (requires SuperLU)
* `VTK <https://vtk.org/>`_ (for visuallisation purposes, we use it in
  combination with `Paraview <https://www.paraview.org/>`_)

.. important::

   You do not need to install these packages for basic use of
   SciCell++, install these packages only if you require additional
   features.
   
.. important::
   
   If you used our provided spack :download:`file <./spack.yaml>` then
   you have already installed these ones as well.
