Workflows
=========

The most common uses for SciCell++ are described in this section,
these workflows show you how to create your private folder, run demos,
create your own project and include it as part of the demos of
SciCell++.

The main differences on the workflow for Windows and Linux users are
on the graphic interfaces. We provide you with the details for the
graphic interfaces when required.

 .. important::

    All these workflows suppose you have executed SciCell++ on a
    container and the terminal prompt is at the main folder of
    SciCell++.

Beginner workflows
------------------
    
:doc:`workflow/beginner/create_your_private_folder_workflow`
     Every new user requires to create it own private folder to store
     all of his/her work (new features, demos, tests).

:doc:`workflow/beginner/compiling_and_running_demos_workflow`
     The easiest way to start working with SciCell++ is to run any of
     its demos and change the values of the parameters to review its
     effects on the outputs.

:doc:`workflow/beginner/creating_your_own_project_workflow`
     For Windows systems users.

:doc:`workflow/beginner/daily_workflow`
     For Linux systems users.

Intermediate workflows
----------------------
:doc:`workflow/intermediate/add_your_project_to_the_demos_folder_workflow`
     For Windows systems users.
     
:doc:`workflow/intermediate/generate_tar_file_workflow`
     Generate a ``tar`` file to distribute or move SciCell++ into a
     supercomputing cluster.

Advance workflows
-----------------

:doc:`workflow/advanced/generate_doxygen_documentation_workflow`
     Generate full documentation from source code with class diagrams.

Expert workflows
----------------
