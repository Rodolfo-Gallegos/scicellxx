Differential Equations
======================

What is a differential equation?
--------------------------------

A differential equation is any expression where a function :math:`y`
is related to its derivative [Strang2014]_, for example:

.. math::

   \begin{equation}
     \frac{dy}{dt} = y
   \end{equation}

In order to find a solution for this particular equation you must ask,
"what function has the property that its derivative is the very same
function?". In other words, the solution to such equation is a
function that its derivative is the same function :math:`y`. A
function with that property is the exponential fucntion :math:`e^t`,
therefore the solution for the previous differential equation is:

.. math::

   \begin{equation}
     y(t) = e^t
   \end{equation}

Types of differential equations
-------------------------------

Differential equations can be classified according to its degree, its
number of variables, ...
