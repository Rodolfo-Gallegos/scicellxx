A framework, not a library
==========================

At this points we expect that you have sucessfully installed SciCell++
and have run and passed ALL the tests. If that is not the case then go
back to the :ref:`Installation <installation-label_installation.rst>`
section.

SciCell++ is a software framework, that means, we provide you with the
main code structure and you only have to fill-in the specific details
for your project. If SciCell++ would be a software library, then you
would be in charge of the main flow of the program and the tools that
you include, as we mentioned above, this is not the case for SciCell++.

The code that you write becomes part of the framework, this provides
you with the tools for your project. You are always free to
personalise SciCell++ based on your needs **by extending, but not
modifying** its current behavior. It means, you may implement new
features that provide SciCell++ with extra functionalities.
