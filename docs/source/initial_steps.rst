Initial steps
=============

This document shows you how to :ref:`install
<installation-label_initial_steps.rst>`, :ref:`start
<starting_scicellxx_-label_initial_steps.rst>` and :ref:`configure
<configuration-label_initial_steps.rst>` SciCell++ on Windows and
Linux systems.

1. The default installation strategy is based on containers so that
   all software dependencies are preinstalled and ready to use by
   SciCell++. The :ref:`installation
   <installation-label_initial_steps.rst>` section will show you how
   to install the container software for your operating system.

2. Then the :ref:`starting SciCell++
   <starting_scicellxx_-label_initial_steps.rst>` section will show
   you how to start SciCell++ using containers.

3. Once running the container with SciCell++ the :ref:`configuration
   <configuration-label_initial_steps.rst>` section will show you how
   to compile and enable basic and special features for SciCell++.
 
.. _installation-label_initial_steps.rst:

Installation
------------

The default installations use a container strategy, thus that all
software dependencies are preinstalled and ready to use for SciCell++.

:doc:`initial_steps/installation/windows_installation`
     For Windows systems users.

:doc:`initial_steps/installation/linux_installation`
     For Linux systems users. We also provide instructions for a
     non-container based installation in case you have enough spare
     time.

     :ref:`Advanced installation
     <advanced_installation-label_linux_installation.rst>`: Use this
     installation only if you are familiar with Unix based systems,
     within this installation you have full control over the versions
     of the third-part packages used by SciCell++.

.. _starting_scicellxx_-label_initial_steps.rst:
     
Starting SciCell++
------------------

Start the container with all the preinstalled packages for SciCell++
and let it ready for configuration.

:doc:`initial_steps/start_scicellxx/start_scicellxx_windows`
     Use this option to run SciCell++ using the downloaded container.
     
:doc:`initial_steps/start_scicellxx/start_scicellxx_linux`
     Use this option to run SciCell++ by either using the downloaded
     container or using your own packages version installation.
   
.. _configuration-label_initial_steps.rst:

Configuration
-------------

This section guides you through the configuration process of
SciCell++.

 .. important::

    We assume that you successfully installed and executued SciCell++
    on either Windows or Linux, and you have started the docker
    container.

The configuration is performed with help of the ``autogen.sh`` script
which lives in the main SciCell++ folder.

1. In the running terminal make sure you are in the ``scicellxx``
   folder.
2. Execute the automatic generator script by typing:

   .. code-block:: shell

                   ./autogen.sh

   .. important::

      This command executes a full compilation of SciCell++ and runs
      all the demos and tests to make sure you are working with an
      stable copy. If you want a full list of available parameters for
      this script then add the ``-h`` parameter and review the
      :ref:`additional options for autogen.sh
      <autogen.sh-options-label_initial_steps.rst>` section.
      
   A summary of the compilation and testing process is shown once they
   have finished. If no errors were reported then SciCell++ is ready
   to go.

   .. important::

      If you require special features that may not be activated by
      default check the configuration files at the ``./configs``
      folder and have a look at the :ref:`options for these files
      <options_for_the_configuration_file-label_initial_steps.rst>` to
      activate/deactivate special features.

   .. important::

      If you are NOT running SciCell++ within a container but used the
      advanced installation then use the appropiate config files in
      the ``./configs/advanced/`` folder.

   If this is the first time you compiled SciCell++ then you need to
   create your own private folder, check the :doc:`workflows` section
   on how to do this and many other common uses for SciCell++. Also
   check the :doc:`tutorials` and :doc:`demos` documents.

.. _autogen.sh-options-label_initial_steps.rst:
        
Additional options for ``autogen.sh``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Activate the interactive mode for full configuration by passing the
``-i`` parameter.

   .. code-block:: shell

                   ./autogen.sh -i

   .. important::
                   
      We encourage you to check the full list of options by passing
      the ``-h`` parameter, the following may not reflect the full
      list of options for the script.

      This script builds [and runs the test suite of] SciCell++

      OPTIONS:
         -h      Show this message
         -t      Indicates to generate a 'STATIC' or 'SHARED' version of library files
         -b      Build version 'DEBUG' or 'RELEASE'
         -c      Configuration file for additional building tools
         -n      Number of processors to build the framework
         -d      Number of processors to run demos (set to '0' to skip demos testing)
         -i      Interative mode, launches the interactive mode to prompt for FULL configuration options (any other parameters are ignored)
         -r      Generate code coverage report
         -v      Verbose

Options for the configuration file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* SCICELLXX_LIB_TYPE

  Specify the building type of the library ``STATIC`` or ``SHARED``.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: shell

     SCICELLXX_LIB_TYPE=STATIC
  
* SCICELLXX_RANGE_CHECK

  Specify whether to check for out-of-range in vectors or not. This
  significantly increase the running time of your application. We
  recommend you to enable this option only for developing purposes to
  ease you finding errors in the code. When using this option consider
  to compile with debugging options when prompted by the
  ``autogen.sh`` file. Once you move into the release mode disable
  this option and compile with full optimisation when prompted by the
  ``autogen.sh`` file.
  
  Example:
  
  .. code-block:: shell

     SCICELLXX_RANGE_CHECK=TRUE
  
* SCICELLXX_USES_DOUBLE_PRECISION

  Specify whether to use single (``float``) or double (``double``)
  precision at running time.
  
  Example:
  
  .. code-block:: shell

     SCICELLXX_USES_DOUBLE_PRECISION=TRUE
  
* SCICELLXX_USES_ARMADILLO

  Specify whether to use the external library Armadillo for linear
  algebra. You would need to :ref:`install Armadillo
  <armadillo-installation-label_installation.rst>` to enable this
  option.
  
  Example:
  
  .. code-block:: shell

     SCICELLXX_USES_ARMADILLO=FALSE
  
* SCICELLXX_AUTO_FIND_ARMADILLO_PATHS

  Use this option to automatically find the corresponding installation
  folder of Armadillo. Enable this option only if the option
  ``SCICELLXX_USES_ARMADILLO`` was set to ``TRUE``.
  
  Example:
  
  .. code-block:: shell

     SCICELLXX_AUTO_FIND_ARMADILLO_PATHS=TRUE
     
* ARMADILLO_AUTO_FIND_FOLDER

  If you want ot use Armadillo and you set the variable
  ``SCICELLXX_AUTO_FIND_ARMADILLO_PATHS`` to ``TRUE`` you may indicate
  an starting folder for the automatic finding of the Armadillo
  installation.

  Example:
  
  .. code-block:: shell
 
     ARMADILLO_AUTO_FIND_FOLDER=/home/tachidok/local/working/research/armadillo-8.300.3

* ARMADILLO_INCLUDE_DIRS

  If you want to use Armadillo but set the variable
  ``SCICELLXX_AUTO_FIND_ARMADILLO_PATHS`` to ``FALSE`` you must
  indicate the ``include`` directory in this option.
  
  Example:
  
  .. code-block:: shell

     ARMADILLO_INCLUDE_DIRS=/home/tachidok/local/working/research/armadillo-8.300.3/installation/include

* ARMADILLO_LIBRARIES

  If you want to use Armadillo but set the variable
  ``SCICELLXX_AUTO_FIND_ARMADILLO_PATHS`` to ``FALSE`` you must
  indicate the ``lib`` directory in this option.
  
  Example:
  
  .. code-block:: shell

     ARMADILLO_LIBRARIES=/home/tachidok/local/working/research/armadillo-8.300.3/installation/lib/libarmadillo.so.8.300.3
     
* SCICELLXX_USES_VTK

  Specify whether to use the external library VTK for results
  visualization. Some demos require VTK to generate output. You would
  need to :ref:`install VTK <vtk-installation-label_installation.rst>`
  to enable this option.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: shell

     SCICELLXX_USES_VTK=FALSE
  
* SCICELLXX_AUTO_FIND_VTK_PATHS

  Use this option to automatically find the corresponding installation
  folder of VTK. Enable this option only if the option
  ``SCICELLXX_USES_VTK`` was set to ``TRUE``.
  
  Example:

  .. code-block:: shell

     SCICELLXX_AUTO_FIND_VTK_PATHS=TRUE

* VTK_AUTO_FIND_FOLDER

  If you want ot use VTK and you set the variable
  ``SCICELLXX_AUTO_FIND_VTK_PATHS`` to ``TRUE`` you may indicate an
  starting folder for the automatic finding of the VTK installation.
  
  Example:

  .. code-block:: shell

     VTK_AUTO_FIND_FOLDER=/home/tachidok/local/working/research/VTK-8.1.1/VTK-bin
                  
* VTK_INCLUDE_DIRS

  If you want to use VTK but set the variable
  ``SCICELLXX_AUTO_FIND_VTK_PATHS`` to ``FALSE`` you must indicate the
  ``include`` directory in this option.
  
  Example:

  .. code-block:: shell

     VTK_INCLUDE_DIRS=/home/tachidok/local/working/research/VTK-8.1.1/VTK-bin/installation/include/vtk-8.1
     
* VTK_LIBRARIES

  If you want to use VTK but set the variable
  ``SCICELLXX_AUTO_FIND_VTK_PATHS`` to ``FALSE`` you must indicate the
  ``lib`` directory in this option.
  
  Example:

  .. code-block:: shell

     VTK_LIBRARIES=/home/tachidok/local/working/research/VTK-8.1.1/VTK-bin/installation/lib/libvtkalglib-8.1.so.1
     
* SCICELLXX_PANIC_MODE

  This option enables a large number of validations at running time,
  it also enables error messages that may help you to identify
  problems in your code. However, this considerably increase the
  running time of your application. Use this option only at developing
  time. Deactivate this function when runnig on release mode, also
  make sure to activate full optimisation at compilation time when
  prompted by the ``autogen.sh`` script.
  
  Example:

  .. code-block:: shell

     SCICELLXX_PANIC_MODE=TRUE
