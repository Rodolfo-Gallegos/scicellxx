* Stability
* The equation
We test the stability of the methods using the following differential
equation as a test case
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dudt}
 \frac{d}{dt}u(t) = - u(t)^2
\end{equation}
with initial conditions
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:initial_conditions}
 u(0) = 1
\end{equation}

** The analytical solution
The equation \eqref{eq:dudt} has the following anaylitical solution
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dudt}
 u(t) = \frac{1}{1+t}
\end{equation}
