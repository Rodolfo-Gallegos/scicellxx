* Stability
In order to show the stability of the implemente methods we solve an
ODE using different steps sizes and time stepper methods.

The stability states that

* The ordinary differential equation
We test the stability of the methods using the following differential
equation as a test case
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dudt}
 \frac{du}{dt} = - u^2
\end{equation}
with initial conditions
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:initial_conditions}
 u_0 = 1
\end{equation}

* The analytical solution
The equation \eqref{eq:dudt} has the following anaylitical solution:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dudt}
 u(t) = \frac{1}{1+t}
\end{equation}

* The error
We compute the error of the approximation as the difference between
the approximated solution and the analytical solution. That is:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:abs_error}
 e_h = |u_h - u|
\end{equation}
where $u_h$ is the approximated value of $u$ using the step size $h$.

* The methods
We use the following set of methods
 * Explicit methods
  - Euler
  - Runge-Kutta 4
  - Adams-Moulton - Implemented as Predictor/Corrector
 * Implicit methods
  - Backward Euler (BDF1)
  - Adams-Moulton
  - Backward Differential Formula - second order (BDF2)

* The results
- We
