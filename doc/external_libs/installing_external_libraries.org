#+TITLE: Installing external libraries
#+AUTHOR: Julio C.

This guide is to allow [[https://github.com/tachidok/chapchom][chapchom]] to work with external libraries such
as =Armadillo= and =SuperLU= in =Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64 bits=. If you
find any problem or something in this guide makes no sense please
contact the author.

* Requirements
Before installing any of the external libraries in your system ensure
that none of them is already installed in your system, this may
produce crashes between versions.

Once you ensure that non other versions of the external packages are
already installed in your system then proceed to check that you have
the following packages installed in your system.

- cmake (tested with =cmake 3.5.1-1ubuntu3=)
+ libblas-dev (tested with =libblas-common=, =libblas-dev 3.6.0-2ubuntu2=)
+ liblapack-dev (tested with =liblapack-dev 3.6.0-2ubuntu2=)
+ libarpack-dev (tested with =libarpack2=, =libarpack2-dev
  3.3.0-1build2=)
