#+AUTHOR: Julio C.

This guide is to allow [[https://github.com/tachidok/chapchom][chapchom]] to work with =Armadillo 8.300.3= in
=Ubuntu 16.04 LTS 64 bits=. If you find any problem or something in
this guide makes no sense please contact the author.

Please also refer to the [[http://arma.sourceforge.net/][original documentation]] in case you are having
troubles with the installation.

* Requirements
Before installing this version of Armadillo please check that you have
not any other version of Armadillo already installed in your
system. If that is the case then proceed to uninstall it.

Once you ensure that Armadillo is not already installed in your system
then proceed to check that you have the following packages installed
in your system.
- cmake (tested with =cmake 3.5.1-1ubuntu3=)

The following set of packages are optional, however we highly
recommend you to install them to improve performance.

+ +libopenblas-dev+
+ libblas-dev (tested with =libblas-common=, =libblas-dev 3.6.0-2ubuntu2=)
+ liblapack-dev (tested with =liblapack-dev 3.6.0-2ubuntu2=)
+ libarpack-dev (tested with =libarpack2=, =libarpack2-dev 3.3.0-1build2=)
+ SuperLU (tested with =SuperLU_5.2.0=). For this one check the
  installation file in the doc folder.

According to Armadillo's documentation, LAPACK and BLAS are used to
work with dense matrices, meanwhile ARPACK and SuperLU are used to
work with sparese matrices. If you want to use SuperLU then you need
to stick to version 5.2 (check README.txt:146 of Armadillo
documentation). If you want to use OpenMP then make sure you are using
version 3.1 or newer (check README.txt:372 of Armadillo
documentation).
