\chapter[Here]{Coding style}
Here we present a kind of rules to happily coding together. First of
all, as you may already noticed, we use C++ as our programming
language. Why? well, that is because of its widely continuous
spreading along the scientific community and all its nicely offered
features.

The list of rules that you'll find here were taken from our own
experience. We took what has worked for us when working in cooperative
projects, and set aside those sily things that only made cooperation
painful instead of fun. Thus, sit back, relax and continue reading.

\section{Comments}
There is nothing more frustrating than having to review someone's else
code (and sometimes or own code) and find out that the variables take
names as those presented in Table
\ref{tbl:variables_names_when_learning_to_program}, the function names
are not representative of the work performed by the funcition, and
there is not a single commented line that tell us why the code is
doing what it is doing or what is the intented function of the
code. We may have to either 
\begin{itemize}
\item spend a lot of time and effort to understand what is going on
  with the code, or
\item directly talk with the person that developed that code to
  explain it to us.
\end{itemize}
Well, this may have been avoided if the code had been at least
commented.

One of the things we think is quite important to have is self
explanatory code, which may be obtained by using appropriate variables
and functions names, indentation and few comments for the tricky parts
of the code.

comment the code when the code itself does not tells you the complete
histoty.

Therefore, there is only one and simple rule to follow regarding
comments in your code. \textbf{Comment your work as much as you
  can}. Hope you got it, if not here it is again. \textbf{Comment
  your work as much as you can}.

\section{Indentation}
This is simple, indent your code for easy reading. I use emacs as my
preferred editor and I have it configured to create one whitespace
when I press TAB. You can copy and use my emacs configuration file
(.emacs) from the the \textbf{tools} folder.

\section{Variables}
We use variables to store values or data that are used frequently in
the body of a function or as part of a class.

\subsection{Variables names}
Use variable names that reflect the values or data stored in the
variable. If you want to store the velocity use \texttt{v} or
\texttt{velocity} as the variable name.

Avoid using the well known variables names:
\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    \texttt{var1} & \texttt{var2} & \texttt{varn}\\
    \hline
    \texttt{value} & \texttt{variable} & \texttt{my\_variable}\\
    \hline
    \texttt{this\_variable} & \texttt{other\_variable} &
    \texttt{another\_variable}\\
    \hline
    \texttt{delete\_variable} &  \texttt{here} & \texttt{there}\\
    \hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tbl:variables_names_when_learning_to_program}
\caption{Variables names used when learning to program.}.
\end{table}
I know you (use?) have used those variable names, everyone does it.

\subsection{Variables types}
Use \texttt{unsigned} instead of \texttt{int} in loops (\texttt{for}
or \texttt{while}) that do not require negative indexes.

\subsection{\texttt{Const} or variable?}
Well, it happens that in C++, variables that do not pretend to change
their value along the entire exection of the program are declared with
a \texttt{const} before the variable type. They why are they still
called variables, well you may be interested to read this.

Anyway, use \texttt{const} on variables that are not intented to
change their value. Remember that when using \texttt{const} you need
to specify the value of the variable at the time of its declaration.

\section{Functions}
Functions are a great idea that let us split a complicated tasks in
small (or not that small) and easy to digest sub-tasks. We can
implement a complex task as a set of subtasks, each implementing a
basic idea that may be re-used in other complex tasks.

Think of a function as an independent task that may even call other
functions to perform its job. A funtion

\subsection{Functions types}

\subsection{Functions names}
When working in small-individual project it is quite tempting to use
short name functions, first because no one else will use (or review)
our code, and second because of laziness. We pretend that this library
be (re-)used by a large community, thus function's names that reflect
the intention or work performed by the function is a good way to
promote reusability.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Functions names MUST all be in lowercase.
  \item Use ``\_'' to separate words in the function name.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Split large funtions into sub-task}

\subsection{Input and output arguments}

\subsubsection{Const or non const}
Use ``const'' as much as you can, if you do not need (or do not know)
to change the value of a variable inside a function then use ``const''
before the type of the variable\\

\texttt{const unsigned no\_modified\_variabled} (why is it called a
variable then?)
\\
otherwise do not use ``const'' \texttt{unsigned modified\_variable}.


\subsubsection{Pass by copy or pass by reference}
Only pass arguments by copy when they are a single value, such as an
integer or a double value. Any other argument MUST be passed by
reference. This is to avoid copying large vectors, matrices or objects
and thus run out of memory because of the many copies of the same
object in memory. If we do not really need a copy of every single
element in a vector, matrix or object then why should we make a copy
ot it?

Examples of passing arguments by reference here soon

Use \& when passing an argument by reference
