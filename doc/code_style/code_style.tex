\chapter{Coding style}
Comming soon ... but should have noticed we use C++.

\section{Comments}
There is one and only simple rule here. Comment your work as much as
you can.

\section{Variables}
We use variables to store values or data that are used frequently in
the body of a function or as part of a class.

\subsection{Variables names}
Use variable names that reflect the values or data stored in the
variable. If you want to store the velocity use \texttt{v} or
\texttt{velocity} as the variable name.

Avoid using the well known variables names:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \texttt{var1}\\
  \item \texttt{var2}\\
  \item \texttt{varn}\\
  \item \texttt{value}\\
  \item \texttt{variable}\\
  \item \texttt{my\_variable}\\
  \item \texttt{this\_variable}\\
  \item \texttt{other\_variable}\\
  \item \texttt{another\_variable}\\
  \item \texttt{here}\\
  \item \texttt{there}
\end{itemize}
I know you (use?) have used those variable names, everyone does it.

\subsection{Variables types}
Use \texttt{unsigned} instead of \texttt{int} in loops (\texttt{for}
or \texttt{while}) that do not require negative indexes.

\subsection{\texttt{Const} or variable?}
Well, it happens that in C++, variables that do not pretend to change
their value along the entire exection of the program are declared with
a \texttt{const} before the variable type. They why are they still
called variables, well you may be interested to read this.

Anyway, use \texttt{const} on variables that are not intented to
change their value. Remember that when using \texttt{const} you need
to specify the value of the variable at the time of its declaration.

\section{Functions}
Functions are a great idea that let us split a complicated tasks in
small (or not that small) and easy to digest sub-tasks. We can
implement a complex task as a set of subtasks, each implementing a
basic idea that may be re-used in other complex tasks.

Think of a function as an independent task that may even call other
functions to perform its job. A funtion

\subsection{Functions types}

\subsection{Functions names}
When working in small-individual project it is quite tempting to use
short name functions, first because no one else will use (or review)
our code, and second because of laziness. We pretend that this library
be (re-)used by a large community, thus function's names that reflect
the intention or work performed by the function is a good way to
promote reusability.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Functions names MUST all be in lowercase.
  \item Use ``\_'' to separate words in the function name.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Input and output arguments}

\subsubsection{Const or non const}
Use ``const'' as much as you can, if you do not need (or do not know)
to change the value of a variable inside a function then use ``const''
before the type of the variable\\

\texttt{const unsigned no\_modified\_variabled} (why is it called a
variable then?)
\\
otherwise do not use ``const'' \texttt{unsigned modified\_variable}.


\subsubsection{Pass by copy or pass by reference}
Only pass arguments by copy when they are a single value, such as an
integer or a double value. Any other argument MUST be passed by
reference. This is to avoid copying large vectors, matrices or objects
and thus run out of memory because of the many copies of the same
object in memory. If we do not really need a copy of every single
element in a vector, matrix or object then why should we make a copy
ot it?

Examples of passing arguments by reference here soon

Use \& when passing an argument by reference
